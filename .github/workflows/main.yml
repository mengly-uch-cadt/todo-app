    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout the code from GitHub repository
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # Step 2: Set up SSH key and known hosts
    - name: Set up SSH
      run: |
        # Create .ssh directory
        mkdir -p ~/.ssh
        
        # Remove any Windows line endings (if copying from Windows)
        echo "${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}" | sed 's/\r//' > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        
        # Set permissions for the private key
        chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        
        # Add the server's SSH key to known_hosts to prevent SSH verification prompts
        ssh-keyscan -H 157.245.60.124 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
        chmod 644 ~/.ssh/known_hosts
        
        # Start the SSH agent
        eval $(ssh-agent -s)
        
        # Add the private key to the SSH agent
        ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        
        # Verify if the key has been loaded correctly
        ssh-add -l

    # Step 3: Test SSH connection to ensure it works
    - name: Test SSH Connection
      run: |
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no dokku@157.245.60.124 exit

    # Step 4: Deploy to Dokku
    - name: Deploy to Dokku
      run: |
        # Add Dokku as a Git remote
        git remote add dokku dokku@157.245.60.124:todo-list-app

        # Push the code to Dokku (triggering deployment)
        git push dokku main
