    # Step 1: Checkout the code
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # Step 2: Set up SSH for secure connection to the server
    - name: Set up SSH
      run: |
        # Create .ssh directory if it doesn't exist
        mkdir -p ~/.ssh

        # Set permissions for the private key
        chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa

        # Add the DigitalOcean server's SSH key to known_hosts to prevent SSH prompts

      run: |
        # Test the SSH connection to the Dokku server
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no dokku@157.245.60.124 exit

    # Step 4: Deploy to Dokku
